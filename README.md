# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


The initial set up for the time was fairly easy to do. I'm sure there is a less clunky way to do it however.

I had many issues trying to get the div for the text area to be clickable and settled on the use of <input>. Probably not ideal, but getting the div to work on click and then change back to the right color was really difficult and the lesson we did involved using a modal initially and then editing the code to make it clickable, which made it difficult, for me, to set it up without the modal for input, as the lesson simply showed how to modify it.

I tried for hours to understand how to make the correct array and push to it and save to it locally but struggled still. I will have to learn more and revisit this.
